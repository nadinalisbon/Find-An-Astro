![](https://javascript30.com/images/JS3-social-share.png)

Wes Bos' ([@wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos))  created a free JavaScript 30 Day Challenge. These are plain JavaScript exercise, without any libraries, transpilers or frameworks.

Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library.These tutorials rely heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the page. If you are stuck in console.log() land, these videos are your next step. Oh, the stuff we build is really fun!

You should already know some JavaScript to start - This isn't a JavaScript 101 course. You learn by application - encountering many new situations while talking about the hows, the whys and the whats that we use to solve them.
